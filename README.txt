* The .zip file contains the following directories
*  adofiles
*  data
*  documentation
*  dofiles
*  graphs
*  logs
*  proc

* The raw data is in data/
* Original documentation of the raw data is in documentation/
* The do files to replicate results in Stata are in dofiles/
* The processed data produced by the do files will be stored in proc/ (initialy empty)
* User-written programs called by the do files are in adofiles/ 
* Logs generated by the do files will be written in logs/
* Graphs produced by the do files and used in the paper will be stored in graphs/ 

* DO FILES:
* Open dofiles/0_master.do. Change -global base- to the base directory in which 
*  you saved the replication files on your computer.
*  This is the only place anything needs to be changed in the do files as long as your
*  folder structure within the base directory matches that of the original zip file. 
* Do files must be run in order the first time through because only the raw data is included
*  in the replication files.
* It is preferable to use 0_master.do
*  and select which other do files to run by changing the locals defined immediately under
*  * LOCALS * between 0 (don't run that do file) and 1 (run that do file).
